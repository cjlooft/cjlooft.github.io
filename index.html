 <br>

&#9728;&#65039;  Wear light, loose clothing <br> in natural, breathable fabrics.
<br>
Light colors reflect, rather than absorb, the sun's rays.
<br>
 Loose clothing allows airflow, which helps you stay cooler <br> &#128293;Stay away from tight clothing <br>
<br>
&#129482; Cooler fabrics that allow airflow:&#129482; <br> linen <br> cotton 
<br>
	    
	    
&#9728;&#65039;Materials to avoid: <br> Ditch jeans. Denim is one of the heaviest fabrics.<br><br>
&#9728;&#65039;&#9728;&#65039; Other materials to avoid: <br> <font color = "red">nylon, acrylic, polyester </font> <br>
        <font color = "red">Nylon:</font> As a fully synthetic material and is not breathable <br>clothing made from nylon tends to trap heat and sweat against the skin.
        <br> <font color = "red"> Acrylic: </font> 
Much like nylon, acrylic is not a natural fabric. <br> The material can often be hot and abrasive, making it one of the worst summer fabrics.
        <br> <font color = "red">Polyester:</font>
 This common fabric is travel-friendly and wrinkle-resistant, but it also resists moisture,<br> making it less than ideal for hot summer weather.

 &#9728;&#65039; Protect against sunburn.<br> Sunburn affects your body's ability to cool itself,
so protect yourself while outdoors with <font color="yellow"> a wide-brimmed hat </font> and
<font color="yellow"> sunglasses </font> and use a broad-spectrum <font color="yellow"> sunscreen </font>with an SPF of 30 or higher. <br> 
 Apply sunscreen generously and reapply every two hours, or more often if you're sweating.  <br> 
    <br> Cooling towels are also recommended to stay cool.   </h2>
