   3. Never warm up a vehicle in an enclosed area, such as a garage. <br> <br> 
 4. Slow down...Also, do not use cruise control when driving on any slippery surface, such as on ice and snow  <br> <br> 
 5. Increase your following distance enough so that youâ€™ll have plenty of time to stop for vehicles ahead of you - be gentle on the breaks. 
 <br><br> BEWARE: 
Black ice -  is a thin coating of glaze ice on a surface, especially on streets. It can often be practically invisible to drivers or people stepping 
 on it - accidents are caused by loss of traction <br> People are hurrying to get out of the cold. - they might not be as cautious as they should be! </h2>
