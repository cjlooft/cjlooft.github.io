  <h2> 1.  One-Way lanes. <br>   Drive in the RIGHT (or left) direction <br> <br> 2. Speed = less than 10 MPH ...and 5 MPH in parking lanes. <br> <br>
   3. STOP at stop signs. - don't just slow down. - it doesn't matter if no one is in the parking lot -  <br>  <br>  4. Pedestrians (people) have the "right-of-way" 
   while walking in the crosswalk. <br> <br> </h2>
 
 <h1> <b> Parking Lot Rules (for Drivers) <br> </b>  part 2 </h1> 

  <h2> 1.  Cell phone <br>   Stay off the phone. - or use "hands-free" calling <br> <br> 2. Don't swerve in the lanes to avoid speed-bumps <br> <br>
   3. STOP at stop signs. - don't just slow down. <br>- if people are in the crosswalk and you don't stop/yield there could be serious consequences -  <br>  <br> 
    4. Only drop off and pick up at designated areas. <br> - Do you know where these areas are? while walking in the crosswalk. <br> <br>  5. Don't back into parking spaces
-that's the rule! </h2>
